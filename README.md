# Exercise: Sentiment Analysis API

## Problem Statement:
You are given a dataset of customer reviews for a product, and your task is to build an NLP model that performs sentiment analysis to predict whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral. After training the model, your goal is to evaluate its performance, optimize it for serving, and deploy it as an API for real-time sentiment analysis.

## Tasks:

Data Preparation:

1. Preprocess the customer review dataset by performing tasks such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and vectorizing the text data.
Model Development and Training:

2. Choose an appropriate NLP model architecture (e.g., LSTM, BERT) and train it using the preprocessed data.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and a validation dataset.
Model Optimization for Serving:

3. Consider model size, inference speed, and resource utilization for optimization.
Explore techniques like model quantization, model pruning, or compression to reduce model size without significant loss in performance.
Experiment with optimizations to improve inference speed, such as batching predictions or utilizing hardware accelerators like GPUs if available.
Deployment as API:

4. Build an API using a framework like Flask or FastAPI to expose the sentiment analysis functionality.
Implement best practices for API development, including proper error handling, input validation, and authentication if necessary.
Design a well-defined API endpoint for receiving customer reviews and returning sentiment predictions.
Testing and Documentation:

Write unit tests to validate the API's functionality and handle edge cases.
Document the API endpoints, input/output formats, and any additional details necessary for users to integrate and utilize the sentiment analysis API effectively.
